What is the status of your project?
We're currently working on Part 1 still, the overall structure of the code is correct however there remains a few small bugs
that cause the functions to not output the expected output. Although we are still debugging, we are positive that it
is something small since the output is only off by one or two words.


What has each team done to ensure the success of the team?
The main thing that we have done as a team is to communicate effectively; texting each other when we will be on 
discord and working on it together. Another way we are ensuring the success of the team is by debugging together
and bouncing ideas off of each other when we are stuck on a certain portion of the project.



What can each team member do going forward to ensure the success of the team?
Essentially all we have to do as a team and individuals is continue working on the project throughout the week. There 
is no doubt my mind that we will be able to finish promptly with the timeframe given. Another thing that we can do 
going forward is to continue the same level of communication and teamwork throughout the rest of the project.
